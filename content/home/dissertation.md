My dissertation pairs 12 months of fieldwork in India, with novel administrative
data collection, and rigorous causal analysis to understand the continued success of criminal
politicians in India.

Currently, over 40% of Indian Members of Parliament face a criminal charge. Despite intense political competition, candidates facing criminal charges are routinely elected across India at higher rates than clean candidates. My dissertation asks why voters elect “criminal” politicians. And, once elected, how do criminal politicians perform? 

To answer these questions, I construct a novel dataset detailing the criminal histories, wealth, and electoral results of all state legislative candidates in India since 2003 (N = 83,000). I measure political performance with original data on the geo-locations of over 20 million local public works projects from India’s largest anti-poverty scheme (the National Rural Employment Guarantee). Overall, I find criminal politicians underperform in office.
