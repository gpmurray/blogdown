- **Members of the Legislative Assembly**: Candidates, characteristics (criminality, wealth, education,
party, demographics), and constituency results for Indian State Legislators from 2003-2016 (N =
83,000)
- **Polling Station Results and geo-locations**: Electoral results and longitude and latitude coordinates
for polling stations from 10 state legislative elections in 6 Indian states (N = 120,000)
- **National Rural Employment Gaurantee Scheme**: Geo-locations and project details of 20 million local infrastructure projects across India, 2007-2017.

I merged these datasets using fuzzy matching and probabilistic record linkage and included 2001 census data for controls. After I file my dissertation, these datasets can be found on my github.
