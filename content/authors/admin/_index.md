Currently, I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science, with a regional focus on India. I study how corruption and criminal elements impede (or facilitate) public service delivery and how politicians’ personal characteristics shape governance strategies. In particular, I research how criminal politicians influence the delivery of India’s largest anti-poverty program. Methodologically, I’m interested in combining qualitative fieldwork with causal inference using observational and spatial data. My research is funded by the American Institute of Indian Studies Jr. Fellowship, UCLA’s Dissertation Fellowship and the UCLA International Institute.
